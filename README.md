# Tree House Example Client

This client is built in react to demonstrate the Treehouse API

In this demo, you can create a car and source its parts and calculate logistical distances and weighted material movements

To Do:

* Currently, the map API is misbehaving on scroll
* Overall clean up of visual elements and homogenizing the header elements used
* In the interest of speed, this was written quite quickly so code quality is low
