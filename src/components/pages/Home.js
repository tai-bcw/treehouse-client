        There is no doubt carbon offsets will play a large role in the transition to a cleaner earth. However, carbon credits play a diagnostic role for earth’s health similar to medicine for our personal health.
        Without preventative measures, we’re headed towards a costly prescription drug cocktail that merely slows degradation instead of improving health.

        We’re already seeing early signs - Tesla ESG scores trail oil and tobacco giants that irreparably damage the environment and cause millions of deaths per year. 
        <br/><br/>
        Why?
        <br/><br/>
        Opaque scoring systems
        Centralized judgement of what’s right and wrong
        Standards that don’t align business interests with a greener earth

          About This Demo
        </h1>

        This demo utilizes a set of smart contracts deployed on a Hedera Smart Contract service in order to demonstrate a decentralized
        source of truth for publicizing material, locational, and logistical processes.  This is a very minimal deployment of the concepts
        underpinning TreeHouse.  It was created in a hackathon environment but moving forward many improvements would be made.
        <br/><br/>
        By building out a system wherein companies can publish, record, and verify their market actions and incentivize mitigation through
        exposing this data to Verificaition & Validation Bodies (VVB), diagnosing and acting on sustainability goals in earnest becomes much
        more feasible.
        <br/><br/>
        Moving forward Treehouse would also be using an oracle system and possibly Hedera's Guardian project to enhance the connections between
        the act of recording supply chain consumption and creating economic incentives such as carbon credits.
